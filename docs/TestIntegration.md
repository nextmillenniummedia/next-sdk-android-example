# Test Your Integration

Make sure that you've complete the previous steps on SDK integration prior to testing.

## Step 1: Debug Mode

Test ads with either **Android Emulator** at this stage.

If everything's done correctly you should be able to display ads with **Test mode** label, for
example:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/nextmillenniummedia/next-sdk-android-example/blob/2.x/docs/assets/test_ads.jpeg" height="480">
</p>

For the next step you'll be required to enable a flag when initialize SDK which would signal SDK to
serve test ads while in **Release** build.

Enabling a flag is required, since if we don't get a signal we won't be able to serve test ads on
each request made.

        NextSdk.initialize(this, true);
        // or with init callback if you want to get info about initialization status
        NextSdk.initialize(this, true, initializationStatus -> {
            Log.d("APP", initializationStatus.toString());
        });

        NextSdk.initialize(this, true)
        // or with init callback if you want to get info about initialization status
        NextSdk.initialize(this, true) {
            it?.let { Log.d("APP", it.toString()) }
        }
    }
}
```

Kotlin

Once done, you are encouraged to publish your app to **App Tester** for further internal testing.

## Step 2: App Tester

### App-ads.txt

By the time testing, `app-ads.txt` **must** be added into your developer website, for
example: `example.com/app-ads.txt`

Please, contact your account manager [support](support@nextmillennium.io) so you'll be provided with
a proper file to add.

This step is a **must** to start displaying ads.

### Test Integrated Ad Units

Just as in **Debug Mode** you should be able to see 100% of the implemented ads in your application
with a **Test mode** label, however now you'll be able to test ads on physical devices.

If something's not working for you at this stage, don't hesitate and contact our support team.

Once you're sure that everything works as intended make sure to disable the test flag before the app
release on SDK initialization:

Java

```java
public class App extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        NextSdk.initialize(this);
        // or with init callback if you want to get info about initialization status
        NextSdk.initialize(this, initializationStatus -> {
            Log.d("APP", initializationStatus.toString());
        });
    }
}
```

Kotlin

```Kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        NextSdk.initialize(this)
        // or with init callback if you want to get info about initialization status
        NextSdk.initialize(this) {
            it?.let { Log.d("APP", it.toString()) }
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Play Store

Once your ad is released keep researching for better spots for your ads.
